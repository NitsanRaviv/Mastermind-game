# Mastermind Game
A game that i have implemented while doing the course C# and the .Net framework in my Bsc.
The User defines the number of guesses and tries to guess the right colors hiding in a row, 
and for each guess, V stands for correct color and location, and X for a correct color
in a wrong location. if there is no sign than the color and location is wrong.
